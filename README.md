This is extension created to allow users of Waterfox Classic (and possibly other Firefox derivatives) to load polyfills at will.

Currently available polyfills:
- [ResizeObserver](https://github.com/que-etc/resize-observer-polyfill)
- [Webcomponents](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills})

This extension uses libraries:

- [Text Encoding](https://github.com/inexorabletash/text-encoding) *with a slight modification to override built in encoder, otherwise it wouldn't be possible to encode text to charsets other than `utf-8`* 

Licensing information regarding included polyfills is included both in repository and in package in `legal` directory
